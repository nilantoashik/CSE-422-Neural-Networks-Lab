## 📌 Overview

This repository contains laboratory assignments and project implementations for the **CSE-422: Artificial Intelligence (Neural Networks Section)** course.

The main objective of this repository is to understand the **core fundamentals of Neural Networks**, starting from the **Single-Layer Perceptron model**, and implementing everything manually from scratch using Python.

Instead of using external machine learning libraries, all mathematical logic, training loops, activation functions, and weight updates are implemented manually to strengthen conceptual understanding.

# 📘 Assignments Breakdown

---

## 🔹 Lab Assignment 1: Student Performance Predictor

### 📚 Concept
Single Layer Perceptron (Binary Classification)

This assignment builds a perceptron model that predicts whether a student will:

- **Pass (1)**
- **Fail (0)**

based on academic habits.

---

### 📊 Features

- `Study Hours` (per day)
- `Attendance Percentage`

---

### 🧠 Ground Truth Logic

A student passes (`1`) if:

```
Study Hours > 4 AND Attendance > 70
```

Otherwise, the student fails (`0`).

---

### ⚙ Implementation Details

- **Initial Weights:** `[0.1, 0.1]`
- **Bias:** `-0.5`
- **Activation Function:** Step Function
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Learning Rule:** Perceptron Learning Rule

Weight Update Formula:

```
w = w + (learning_rate × error × input)
b = b + (learning_rate × error)
```

---

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding linear classification
- Manual implementation of neural networks
- Observing weight adjustment over epochs
- Error convergence analysis

---

## 🔹 Lab Assignment 2: Fitness & Lifestyle Classifier

### 📚 Concept
Single Layer Perceptron with Analytical Reporting

This assignment extends the perceptron model to classify individuals as:

- **Fit (1)**
- **Unfit (0)**

based on lifestyle habits.

---

### 📊 Features

- `Physical Activity` (hours per day)
- `Sleep` (hours per day)

---

### 🧠 Key Components

#### ✅ Custom Dataset Design
- Synthetic dataset simulating real-life lifestyle patterns
- Balanced class distribution

#### ✅ Training Loop
- Iterative weight updates
- Error monitoring per epoch
- Convergence observation

#### ✅ Interactive Testing
- User input system
- Real-time classification

#### ✅ Report Section
Includes:
- Dataset design explanation
- Labeling strategy
- Weight behavior analysis
- Model performance discussion
